# INTRODUCTION
Welcome to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that encompasses three main tasks. In this project, we have worked on various aspects related to text analysis and processing using NLP techniques and deep learning.

# REVIEW
1. **Analysis and Processing of the Thousand and One Nights using SIMPLE Natural Language Processing**
- This Colab, focuses on the exploration and processing of the famous literary work "The Thousand and One Nights." Through the use of NLP techniques, we have performed text extraction and cleaning, as well as applied various modules for tokenization, normalization, and exploratory analysis of the data.

2. **Classification of Papers in Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence and Networks and Teleprocessing using a Natural Language Processing Approach**
- This Colab, we have focused on the automatic classification of papers into three main categories: Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, and Networks and Teleprocessing. Using an NLP approach, we have applied advanced text processing techniques to extract relevant features from the papers and trained machine learning models for classification.

3. **Multiclass Classification of Tweets using LSTM and MLP with a Deep Learning Approach**
- This Colab, centers around the classification of tweets into multiple categories using two deep learning models: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and MLP (Multilayer Perceptron). We have applied text preprocessing techniques, trained and evaluated the models with the goal of achieving accurate classification of tweets into the desired categories.
